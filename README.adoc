== The JBoss Tools Target Platforms project


=== Summary

JBoss Tools Target Platforms project provides the JBoss Tools Eclipse-based target platforrms used by JBoss Tools projects and Red Hat Developer Studio.

The 'master' branch only contains shared content - see the 4.x branches for the actual target platform definitions. To build them, simply run 'mvn verify' in a given target platform folder.


=== Get the code

The easiest way to get started with the code is to http://help.github.com/forking/[create your own fork],
and then clone your fork:

    $ git clone git@github.com:<you>/jbosstools-target-platforms.git
    $ cd jbosstools-target-platforms
    $ git remote add upstream git://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms.git

At any time, you can pull changes from the upstream and merge them onto your 4.71.x branch:

    $ git checkout 4.71.x               # switches to the '4.71.x' branch
    $ git pull upstream 4.71.x          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/4.71.x' onto your '4.71.x' branch
    $ git push origin                  # pushes all the updates to your fork, which should be in-sync with 'upstream'

The general idea is to keep your '4.71.x' branch in-sync with the
'upstream/4.71.x'.


=== Build target platform(s) locally

See https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/building/target_platforms/target_platforms_updates.adoc#build-target-platforms-locally[Build target platform(s) locally]

=== Fetch target platform (with sources) from zip

See https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/building/target_platforms/target_platforms_for_consumers.adoc#build-target-platform-bootstrapped-from-zip[Build target platform(s) bootstrapped from zip]

=== Update versions of IUs in the .target files

See https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-devdoc/blob/master/building/target_platforms/target_platforms_updates.adoc#update-versions-of-ius-in-the-target-files[Update versions of IUs in the .target files]


=== Contribute fixes and features

_JBoss Tools Target Platforms_ is open source, and we welcome anybody that wants to
participate and contribute!

If you want to fix a bug or make any changes, please log an issue in
the https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE[JBoss Tools JIRA]
describing the bug or new feature and give it a component type of
`build`. Then we highly recommend making the changes on a
topic branch named with the JIRA issue number. For example, this
command creates a branch for the JBIDE-1234 issue:

    $ git checkout -b jbide-1234

After you're happy with your changes and a full build (with unit
tests) runs successfully, commit your changes on your topic branch
(with good comments). Then it's time to check for any recent changes
that were made in the official repository:

    $ git checkout 4.71.x               # switches to the '4.71.x' branch
    $ git pull upstream 4.71.x          # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/4.71.x' onto your '4.71.x' branch
    $ git checkout jbide-1234           # switches to your topic branch
    $ git rebase 4.71.x                 # reapplies your changes on top of the latest in 4.71.x
                                        (i.e., the latest from 4.71.x will be the new base for your changes)

If the pull grabbed a lot of changes, you should rerun your build with
tests enabled to make sure your changes are still good.

You can then push your topic branch and its changes into your public fork repository:

    $ git push origin jbide-1234         # pushes your topic branch into your public fork of JBoss Tools Target Platforms

And then http://help.github.com/pull-requests/[generate a pull-request] where we can
review the proposed changes, comment on them, discuss them with you,
and if everything is good merge the changes right into the official
repository.

==== Using Jenkins

To contribute a fix using Jenkins, you can use two Jenkins jobs - one to pull the new requirement mirror, and a second to build a submitted PR.

Here's how that works.

 Update https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/DevStudio/view/DevStudio_Master/job/jbosstoolstargetplatformrequirements-mirror-matrix/configure[jbosstoolstargetplatformrequirements-mirror-matrix] job config to add new triple:

    docker;2.1.0.201608232052;download.eclipse.org_-_linuxtools_-_update-neon-1-docker-rc1

* Run the job to create new mirrors for each triple. The build's description will include the new URLs of the requirements under http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/requirements/

* When done, update these two files to insert the new <repository location="..."/>  for Docker.

(This could be done by a sed script.)

* Run https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-build-ci/blob/jbosstools-4.4.x/util/verifyTarget.sh[verifyTarget.sh] to also update the versions of IUs, not just the URLs, in jbosstools/ folder and verify there are no duplicates / conflicts. This could take up to an hour depending on your network speed.

(Both runs can be done in parallel if you stagger them about 5 mins apart, but COULD result in maven errors, so just run it again if that happens.)

* Submit a PR like https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-target-platforms/pull/232[this one]. Within 5 minutes, a PR builder job will fire and your PR will be updated with the build status when the build is complete.

* Once your PR is merged, it can be built using this https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/jbosstoolstargetplatforms-matrix/[jbosstoolstargetplatforms-matrix] job.

* When done (about 1 hr), announce the change on the http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/jbosstools-dev/[jbosstools-dev] list.
